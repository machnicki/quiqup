#Test for Quiqup

##Maps
I have tried to use angular-google-maps, but it seems to be too heavy and not matured enought.

I have decided to use http://leafletjs.com/, which is simplest solution.

##UI
I have used Bootstrap for styling

##ToDo
Use Node.js to get XML and serve transformed data

##Run the app
Start the server
``` npm start ```
